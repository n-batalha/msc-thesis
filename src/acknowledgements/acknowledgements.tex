I am in great debt to the talented teachers I have encountered in this faculty and before who inspired me to get this far.

In particular, this thesis would not have been written without the fantastic support from my advisor Professor Gustavo Granja, whose patience and contributions far exceed anything I could have asked.

Also I would like to thank my colleagues for the helpful discussions and insights, and my family and friends who made it possible.

Special thanks to Professor John Baez for making available online so much (and diverse) material contagiously passionate, and to Professor Roger Picken and colleagues whose articles were the reason this study started.
